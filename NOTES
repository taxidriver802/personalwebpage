<!-- 🔍 Advanced Repo Sorting & Filtering -->

By Tech Stack (language used): Use the language field from GitHub’s API.

By Last Updated, Stars, Forks, or Open Issues.

By Type: Public vs Private, Forked vs Original.

Custom Tags: Let users tag their repos (like “client work,” “school project,” etc.)

<!-- 💬 Custom Comments & Social Layer -->

Add a comments section under each repo that other users (logged in) can reply to.

Optional: Add emoji reactions or a simple “like” system to comments.

Add threaded replies for deeper convo threads.

Notifications when someone comments on your repo (bonus feature).

<!-- ⭐ Favoriting / Bookmarking -->

Let users “favorite” other users’ repos (not just their own).

Create a Favorites tab to view all bookmarked projects.

Maybe even allow folders or groups of favorites (like Pinterest boards).

<!-- 🎨 Personalized Repo Display -->

Let users customize the layout of how repos are shown (card view, list view, etc.)

Display key info: languages used (with color bars), last commit date, stars, etc.

Maybe use GitHub’s contribution chart as a visual element.

<!-- 🧠 Analytics & Insights (Optional) -->

Simple analytics dashboard:
“Most used language”
“Most starred repo”
“Repo with most commits”

Fun visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs).

<!-- 🧰 Extras to Stand Out -->

Project Showcase Mode: Let users highlight certain repos with extra descriptions, images, or demo links.

Clone to Try: Button that lets other users clone/download the repo.

Skill Tags: Auto-generate or manually assign tags like “React,” “Express,” etc., and filter/search by skills.

Follow System: Follow other users on your app (not GitHub itself).

Private Notes: Add private notes visible only to you on each repo.
